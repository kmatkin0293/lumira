name: rebrand-thoughtspot-portal
description: Guided builder that turns the reusable Vite + React + @thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk portal template into a fully-skinned client app — brand, theme, data, tabs, custom actions, monetization and user tiers — from a plain-language interview. Use when someone wants to build / skin / white-label / clone a ThoughtSpot embedded analytics portal for a company (e.g. "build the portal for Acme", "skin the app for <client>", "make a ThoughtSpot demo app for X"). Walks a branching question tree (no coding required from the user), then clones the template and wires everything up, building and verifying at each step. Not for building a brand-new app architecture from scratch, or non-ThoughtSpot apps.

# Build a client ThoughtSpot portal (guided)

You are running a **non-technical intake**: the user answers plain-language
questions, you do all the code. Flow: **interview → build → verify → (ask before) deploy.**
Never make the user touch code or GUIDs beyond pasting the values you ask for.

## The base template

The base app is **bundled inside this skill** at `template-tse/` (next to this
`SKILL.md`) — a brand-neutral ("Northwind") build that already contains every
feature toggleable: Analytics liveboard, inline-insights list tab, custom-action
viz tab, standalone Spotter tab, "fancy" Ask-AI chat, monetization paywall,
Premium/Basic tiers, host filters, light+dark theme. You keep what the answers ask
for and strip the rest.

**First-time setup: none needed.** The bundled template's deps are installed
**automatically** by the codemod on the first build (it detects a missing
`node_modules` and runs `npm install` once, looking in `~/.node/bin` if npm isn't on
PATH). The codemod resolves the template relative to itself, so the skill works from
any project directory. Each generated `<slug>-tse/` app symlinks its `node_modules` to
the bundled template's, so nothing to install per app.

The codemod copies the template to `<client>-tse/` (kebab-case) in the current project,
excluding `node_modules dist .vercel .env.local`.

## Prerequisite — Node.js (check once, before the first build)

The codemod and the generated Vite app need Node. Verify it early (up front, or just
before Step 2). If it's missing, install it — **no admin rights required** — so a
Node-less user never hits a wall:

1. **Check:** run `node -v`, and also `~/.node/bin/node -v` (it may be installed there
   but off PATH). If either prints a version, you're set — skip the install.
2. **If Node is missing**, ask the user's OK (it's a system change + needs internet),
   then install it to `~/.node` (no sudo), auto-detecting OS/arch:
   ```bash
   VER=v22.13.1
   OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')            # darwin | linux
   ARCH=$(uname -m); [ "$ARCH" = "aarch64" ] && ARCH=arm64; [ "$ARCH" = "x86_64" ] && ARCH=x64
   curl -fsSL "https://nodejs.org/dist/$VER/node-$VER-$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz" | tar -xz -C /tmp
   rm -rf ~/.node && mv "/tmp/node-$VER-$OS-$ARCH" ~/.node
   export PATH="$HOME/.node/bin:$PATH"
   ```
   (Windows: install from https://nodejs.org/en/download instead of the tarball.)
3. Prepend `~/.node/bin` to PATH for every `node`/`npm`/`npx` you run, and offer to
   append that line to the user's `~/.zshrc` so future terminals see it. Confirm
   `node -v` works, then continue.

This makes the skill self-sufficient regardless of entry path — even if the user
skipped the onboarding prompt and just asked you to build a portal.

## Step 0 — Show the "gather-first" card (before any question)

People stall mid-interview when a question asks for a GUID they don't have open. So
**before** asking anything, post this checklist in one plain-language message and let
them collect it all at once. Keep it short — don't explain fields yet, just list what
to have ready:

> **Before we start, grab these — you'll paste them as we go (takes ~2 min):**
> 1. **Your ThoughtSpot host URL** (e.g. `https://your-co.thoughtspot.cloud`)
> 2. **The main dashboard's Liveboard ID** — open the liveboard; it's the long ID in
>    the URL after `/pinboard/` or `/liveboard/`.
> 3. **Your data model / worksheet ID** — the source the dashboard is built on.
> 4. **A brand screenshot** — your website, product UI, or logo. I'll pull the colors
>    from it. (A hex color works too if you have no image.)
> 5. *(optional)* Any extra Liveboard/viz IDs if you want more than one tab.
> 6. Your **logo** file (SVG or PNG), or say the word and I'll generate a wordmark.
>
> Building a demo with no real cluster? Just say so — I'll make up realistic values.

Wait for a "ready" (or their first pastes), then start the interview. Don't block on
it — if they'd rather answer as they go, proceed; the card just prevents the ambush.

## Step 1 — Run the interview (LOCKED SCRIPT — ask verbatim)

This interview is a **fixed script**, not a topic list. Run the rounds below **in this
exact order**, using the **exact wording** given:

- **Ask each question exactly as written.** Do NOT reword, rephrase, summarize, merge,
  reorder, add, or drop questions. The `AskUserQuestion` `question`/`header`/`option`
  text and the free-text messages are canonical — copy them.
- **The only permitted variation is skipping an entire round** when its mode/gate says
  to (Basic mode skips Rounds 3, 4, 6; a "No" gate skips that round's follow-up). You
  never skip a round for any other reason, and you never invent extra questions.
- **Sequencing rule:** never fire `AskUserQuestion` in the *same turn* as a free-text
  request — the popup blocks the text box. When a round has both, send the **free-text
  message first, wait for the reply, then** fire the popup.
- Collect answers into the **spec** (schema at the bottom).

Rounds marked **[ADVANCED ONLY]** are skipped entirely in Basic mode.

**Feature reference — MANDATORY step, do NOT skip (Advanced only).** Images can't render
inside the `AskUserQuestion` popup, so **as the very first action when you reach Round 3
(before asking anything in it), you MUST paste the feature-reference link to the user.**
Do NOT publish an Artifact — use this fixed, already-shared link:

> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDzpqJ2JSa4yzjICeJzLBu8Wile7PFuAwbM1ZpoBjs0/edit?usp=sharing
>
> Say, verbatim:
> *"Here's a visual reference for the optional features as we go: <link above>."*

It shows the four optional features (Inline insights, Custom action, Monetization paywall,
Add Report), and each feature round below points the user to its section. If you find
yourself asking the Round 3 gate **without** having posted this link, stop and post it
first. In **Basic** mode, skip it (those rounds don't run).

---

**ROUND 0 — Build scope** · `AskUserQuestion`
- question: `Should this be a Basic demo or the full Advanced build?`
- header: `Build scope` · multiSelect: false
- options:
  - `Advanced (full build)` — All tabs: Analytics, inline insights, a custom-action workflow, Add-Report pinning, Ask-AI + Spotter, tiers/monetization.
  - `Basic demo` — Analytics dashboards + Spotter + Ask-AI + theme only. Skips inline, custom-action, and Add-Report.

Record as `mode`. **If Basic → skip Rounds 3, 4, 6.**

**ROUND 1 — Brand** · free-text message (verbatim):
> Tell me about the brand — answer in one message:
> 1. Company name
> 2. AI assistant name (or I'll default to "Ask <Company> AI")
> 3. One line on what they do
> 4. Website URL
>
> Then attach your **logo** (SVG preferred, PNG fine) — or say "generate one" and I'll make a wordmark.

**ROUND 2 — Data & filters** · free-text FIRST (verbatim):
> Now the data — paste in one message (a full ThoughtSpot **link** is fine, I'll pull the ID out):
> 1. Your ThoughtSpot **host URL** (e.g. `https://your-co.thoughtspot.cloud`) — or paste any link from your cluster and I'll read the host from it.
> 2. Main **Analytics liveboard** — paste its URL or ID.
> 3. Data **model / worksheet** — paste its URL or ID.
> 4. Which columns do you want to filter the main dashboard (runtime filters)? List them
> 5. A **date column** to filter by, if any (optional)
>
> No real cluster? Say "make it up" and I'll generate realistic values.

**Reading pasted URLs (do this yourself — never make the user classify a GUID):**
A GUID is `[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}`; the **host** is the
URL's origin (e.g. `team2.thoughtspot.cloud`). Infer the object **type** from the path
segment right before the GUID:
- `…/pinboard/<G>` or `…/liveboard/<G>` → **Liveboard** (Analytics / inline / action liveboard)
- `…/embed/viz/<LB>/<VIZ>` or `…/pinboard/<LB>/<VIZ>` → `<LB>` is the **liveboard**, `<VIZ>` is the **viz** (use for the custom-action viz + its parent liveboard)
- `…/answer/<G>` or `…/saved-answer/<G>` → a **saved Answer**, NOT a liveboard (inline/analytics need a *liveboard* — flag it)
- `…/data/tables/<G>`, `…/data/models/<G>`, `…/data/objects/<G>`, `…/worksheet/<G>` → **Model / worksheet** (the data source)

**Always echo the type back to confirm** ("that link is a Liveboard, id `…` — right?") — TS
URL formats vary by version. If the user pastes a **bare GUID with no URL**, you can't infer
the type — ask which it is. Map each confirmed value to its spec field (analyticsLiveboard,
model, inlineLiveboard, actionLiveboard + actionViz).

…then `AskUserQuestion` — ask **both** questions below in the **same popup**:
- question: `How should the embedded ThoughtSpot content authenticate?`
- header: `Auth` · multiSelect: false
- options:
  - `Basic – typed credentials (Recommended)` — A username/password login gate in the app.
  - `None – ride existing session` — Embeds use whatever ThoughtSpot session is already signed in. Simplest for demos.
  - `Trusted – advanced` — Token-based trusted auth; needs backend setup.
- question: `How should the app's navigation look?`
- header: `Nav layout` · multiSelect: false
- options:
  - `Top bar` — Horizontal tabs across the top (the default look).
  - `Left sidebar` — A vertical left-hand nav panel, matching many enterprise app UIs.

Record the nav answer as `features.navLayout` (`top` | `sidebar`). If the user shared a
brand/product screenshot whose menu is a left panel, prefer `sidebar` and confirm.

**ROUND 3 — Inline-insights tab** · **[ADVANCED ONLY]** · *(point them to the "Inline insights" mockup in the feature reference)* · `AskUserQuestion` gate:
- question: `Add an inline-insights tab? (List where each row of the Client App expands to reveal a ThoughtSpot Liveboard / component filtered to the list item)`
- header: `Inline insights` · multiSelect: false
- options: `Yes, add it` · `No, skip it`

If **Yes**, free-text — **fill the bracketed examples yourself** from the company (Round 1)
and the model/worksheet; don't print the literal brackets:
> Inline-insights details — paste in one message:
> 1. The inline **Liveboard ID** (must be a liveboard, not a viz/answer)
> 2. **What do you want to name this tab?** (some examples: <2–3 tab-name ideas fitting the company>)
> 3. **Which attribute / dimension should label each row?** (some examples: <2–3 dimensions that fit this model>)
> 4. **Up to 3 metric columns to show per row** (some examples: <2–3 measures that fit this model>)

For 2–4, generate the example suggestions from the company's domain and the
model/worksheet — concrete, plausible names, not placeholders like "x/y".

**ROUND 4 — Custom-action workflow** · **[ADVANCED ONLY]** · *(point them to the "Custom action" mockup in the feature reference)* · `AskUserQuestion` gate:
- question: `Add a custom-action workflow? (a button on a viz row that opens your own screen/modal)`
- header: `Custom action` · multiSelect: false
- options: `Yes, add it` · `No, skip it`

If **Yes**, free-text — **fill the bracketed examples yourself** from the company (Round 1);
don't print the literal brackets:
> Custom-action details — paste in one message:
> 1. The **viz ID** the action lives on, and its parent **Liveboard ID**
> 2. The action's **button label** (some examples: <2–3 action labels fitting the company>)
> 3. The **tab name** (some examples: <2–3 tab-name ideas fitting the company>)
> 4. Describe the workflow exactly: what screen/modal opens on click, which row fields pre-fill which inputs, and what "Submit" does. (A screenshot of the target screen is **optional** but helps — attach one if you have it.)
>
> I'll build exactly that screen — not a generic form.

For 2–3, generate the example suggestions from the company's domain — concrete, plausible names.

You then build **exactly that screen** (rebuilding the scaffold modal); never fall back
to the generic "Request Bid" form. If the user can't describe a workflow, ask whether a
simple labeled form is acceptable or the action should be dropped.

**ROUND 5 — Ask-AI & tiers** · *(for the Monetize question, point them to the "Monetization paywall" mockup in the feature reference)* · `AskUserQuestion` (batch all four in one call):
- Q1 — question: `How should Ask-AI work?` · header: `Ask-AI` · options: `Both` · `Standalone Spotter only` · `Fancy chat only`
- Q2 — question: `Floating chatbot in the bottom-right corner?` · header: `Chatbot` · options: `Yes` · `No`
- Q3 — question: `Add a monetization paywall?` · header: `Monetize` · options: `No` · `Yes`
- Q4 — question: `Feature gating by tier (Premium vs Basic)?` · header: `Tiers` · options: `No` · `Yes`

If **Monetize = Yes**, free-text: `Which AI question should trigger the paywall? (e.g. the 3rd)`
If **Tiers = Yes** — ask the monetize free-text first (if any), wait, then `AskUserQuestion`:
- question: `Which actions should the Basic tier lose?`
- header: `Basic loses` · multiSelect: true
- options: `Drill-down` · `Ask AI` · `Downloads`
- If the user says "defaults" / "pick the defaults", use all three.

**ROUND 6 — Add Report (custom report building / addition flow)** · **[ADVANCED ONLY]** · *(point them to the "Add Report" mockup in the feature reference)* · `AskUserQuestion`:
- question: `Add Report (custom report building / addition flow)?`
- header: `Add Report` · multiSelect: false
- options:
  - `No, skip it` — No Add-Report menu, pin flow, or PinModal.
  - `Yes — Ask-AI (Spotter) only` — Include the flow but only the Spotter/Ask-AI builder; skip the SearchEmbed Report Builder (which renders poorly in dark theme).
  - `Yes — with both Ask AI & Report Builder (Search Data)` — Include the full flow: both the Spotter/Ask-AI builder and the SearchEmbed Report Builder. Caveat: SearchEmbed renders poorly in dark — demo in Light theme.

**Caveat to surface with this round:** the Report Builder uses `SearchEmbed`, which
renders poorly in **dark** theme. So the user can either (a) include only the Ask-AI
(Spotter) builder and drop SearchEmbed, or (b) keep SearchEmbed and demo in **Light**.
If **No**, strip the Add-Report menu, the pin flow, and `PinModal`. If **Ask-AI only**,
keep the pin flow + Spotter builder but strip the SearchEmbed Report Builder.

**ROUND 7 — Theme** · **one free-text message — ask for everything at once** (verbatim):
> Last part — the look. Answer in one message (attach what you have):
> 1. **Screenshot** — upload one I can pull your palette from (your website, product UI, a marketing shot, or your logo). A live URL works too; a named hex color only if you have no image at all.
> 2. **Font** — name a specific font (a Google font like "Poppins" is easiest) or attach the file; name separate title vs body fonts if you want. No preference? Say so and I'll match the brand.
> 3. **Theme mode** — light, dark, or both? (and which is the default)
> 4. **Any specific customizations?** — e.g. gradients on titles, particular hues, "make the KPIs pop", rounded cards. Or "none".
> 5. **Home page?** — do you want a brand **Home landing page** as the first thing users see after login (no dashboards — just your headline, a tagline, a call-to-action, and a few highlight stats)? If yes, can I model it on the screenshot you uploaded, or do you have any specific requirements? (Say "no home page" to skip.)

The **screenshot is the palette reference** — derive the whole palette from it; don't jump
to a color-picker. The screenshot is still REQUIRED (a URL or, last resort, a named color
substitutes). After they reply, **confirm the primary/accent you read from the image**
before moving on.

**Home page (item 5):** record as `features.home`. If yes, also fill `content.landing`
(eyebrow, headline segments with `accent`, subline, ctaLabel, stats) derived from the
screenshot / their requirements — the codemod ships a scaffold `Landing.tsx` that you then
tailor to match (a hand-finish step, like the custom-action modal). It must **not** show
analytics or embeds. If no, leave `features.home` off and the tab is never generated.

There is **no deploy question** — always **build + run locally** by default. Only
deploy to Vercel if the user explicitly asks for it afterward.

### Completeness gate — do NOT skip, do NOT fabricate

Before you build, you MUST have run **every non-skipped round 0–7** and have an explicit
answer for each, including the free-text ones. Never invent or silently default a value
the user could provide. (Skipping a round is only allowed per the Round's mode/gate.)

- **Round 2 (Data) is REQUIRED free-text — actually ask for it and wait.** You must
  collect the host URL, the Analytics liveboard GUID, the model/worksheet GUID, (if inline
  enabled) the inline liveboard GUID, (if action enabled) the action viz + its liveboard
  GUID, the filter columns, and the date column. **Do NOT invent GUIDs or a host.** If the
  user is building a fictitious/demo app, ask explicitly "want me to make these up?" — get
  a yes per-value; don't assume it.
- **Round 7 (Theme) — ask for BOTH the screenshot/URL AND the font** (a Google font by
  name, or an attached file). Never pick a font yourself without asking.
- The Round 5 batched popup must **not drop the free-text follow-ups** it triggers
  (paywall trigger, tier-disabled actions), nor the free-text asks in other rounds.

Then **echo the COMPLETE spec back in plain language** — every field, round by round,
flagging anything the user let you make up — and get an explicit **"go"** before building.
If you catch yourself about to fabricate a value or skip a round, stop and ask instead.

## Step 2 — Build (spec-driven: interview → spec.json → codemod → hand-finish)

The interview becomes a **`spec.json`**; a codemod does the mechanical ~90% in under a
second; you hand-finish the few things a script can't.

1. **Write `spec.json`.** Copy **`references/spec.example.json`** (a complete working
   example) and edit every value per the interview. Field-by-field mapping + the swap-array
   rules are in **`references/spec-schema.md`**. Derive the `theme.light`/`theme.dark` token
   dicts from the brand screenshot/URL; in the `embedSwaps`/`greenSwaps`/`cssSwaps` arrays
   change only the **right-hand** (brand) values — the left-hand hexes are fixed template
   constants.
2. **Run the codemod** from the project root (where you want the app written):
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/rebrand-thoughtspot-portal/scripts/apply-spec.mjs spec.json
   ```
   It clones the bundled `template-tse` → `<slug>-tse/`, renames the brand, writes `content.ts`, patches
   `config.ts` (host/GUIDs/columns/embed theme), switches auth, regenerates the `globals.css`
   theme tokens + `@font-face`, drops in logo/favicon/font, and prunes the tabs `features`
   turns off.
3. **Hand-finish what the codemod can't** (it prints reminders):
   - **Custom-action modal** — if a workflow was described, **MANDATORY**: rebuild the
     scaffold modal to match it (build-playbook §5). Never leave the generic Request Bid form.
   - **Home page** — if `features.home` is on, tailor `src/tabs/Landing.tsx` (and its
     `content.landing` copy) to the screenshot / requirements. Keep it brand/marketing —
     **no analytics or embeds**. The codemod only flips the flag + ships a scaffold.
   - Any bespoke UI the user flagged (custom tables, live lookups).
   (Tabs and the monetize/tiers/pinning/home toggles are handled by the codemod — nothing to do.)
4. **Build:** `export PATH="$HOME/.node/bin:$PATH" && (cd <slug>-tse && npm run build)`.
   Fix any `tsc` errors and rebuild until clean.

**`references/build-playbook.md`** is the reference for WHAT each field maps to and the
non-obvious rules (host protection, solid-color embed buttons, masterpieces flag,
liveboard-vs-viz, `Action` enum names, candidate-column fallback) — consult it when a
codemod result looks off or when hand-editing. (The playbook's per-file manual steps still
work as a fallback if the codemod can't run.)

## Step 3 — Verify, run, (ask to) deploy

- `npm run dev` and give the user the localhost URL.
- Print a **spec recap** + a **"verify on your cluster"** list: exact column names
  the candidate-lists resolved, the CSP/CORS **allowlist** step for the domain, and
  the auth/session requirement.
- Deploy to Vercel only if the user asked (see the playbook's deploy section).

## Spec schema

The interview's answers are written to a **`spec.json`** consumed by the codemod. The full
field-by-field schema, the interview→field mapping, and the fixed-LHS swap rules live in
**`references/spec-schema.md`**; **`references/spec.example.json`** is a complete worked
example to copy and edit. (Deploy is always LOCAL by default — not interviewed; Vercel only
on an explicit later ask.)

## Rules of engagement
- Confirm ambiguous ThoughtSpot IDs by **type** (liveboard / viz / saved answer) — the
  #1 source of blank embeds.
- Prefer **candidate-column lists** over a single guessed name; the app falls back gracefully.
- Keep the user in plain language; you own the terminal, the build, and the fixes.
